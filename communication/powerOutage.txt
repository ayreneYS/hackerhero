1. "I apologize for not being able to make the progress you needed for the day on the important project due to a sudden power outage that lasted for a whole day. Unfortunately, I was unable to put in the hours for the project on Friday and I understand that this may have caused inconvenience. I was looking forward to using the weekend to spend time with friends and family, and unfortunately I am also feeling a bit sick and I am considering taking Monday off as a sick leave. I will make sure to catch up on the work as soon as possible and keep you updated on the progress."

2. If the person I am mentoring is in a similar situation of a sudden power outage, I can advise them to communicate the situation as soon as possible to their supervisor or project manager, as well as any team members who may be affected, offer to provide updates on their progress once the situation is resolved, develop a plan to catch up on any missed work as soon as possible. Remind them to take care of their physical and mental well-being during this time, prioritize their task, be realistic and don't take much load which they can't handle and be transparent and communicate effectively. Also, remember that unexpected events happen and it is important to be adaptable and work together as a team to find solutions.

3. To make up for the lack of progress and hours on the project, I can develop a plan to catch up on any missed work as soon as possible, which could include working extra hours or shifting priorities to ensure that deadlines are met. Communicate this plan to my supervisor, including specific actions I will take to make up for the lost time and keep my supervisor informed on my progress, letting them know if I anticipate any delays or difficulties in catching up. Propose alternatives that can be done to move the project forward or mitigate the impact of the power outage, offer a detailed report on progress and status of the project, be transparent and open to feedback and suggestions on how to improve and catch up on the project, and show willing and dedication to finish the project, making sure to meet the deadlines.

4. I would say "I apologize for missing important deadlines for the project due to the power outage. I'll take full responsibility for the delay and take immediate steps to catch up on the missed work, I'll provide a detailed plan on how I will meet the missed deadlines and expected completion date. I'll keep my supervisor and team informed of my progress and any challenges I may be facing. I'll propose alternative solutions that could help to mitigate the impact of the missed deadlines, such as bringing in additional resources or re-prioritizing tasks. I'll work closely with my supervisor and team to ensure that the project is back on track and that the quality of the deliverables is not compromised, and I'll be willing to put in extra effort and hours to meet the deadlines and show my dedication to the project."
