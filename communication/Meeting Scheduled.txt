1. What went wrong here?

My supervisor scheduled a meeting with me at 3 pm (over Zoom) to go over a few items, but they haven't shown up yet. It's now 3:15 pm and my supervisor still hasn't shown up.

2. If you were super proactive in your communication, what would you have done? What message would you send your supervisor and when would you send this?

To be super proactive in this situation, I would have sent a message to my supervisor before the scheduled meeting time to confirm the meeting and ask if there were any changes to the schedule. I would also send a message at 3:05 pm to inquire if my supervisor was running late or if there were any issues that arose that prevented them from joining the meeting. If it's 3:15 pm and my supervisor still hasn't shown up and hasn't communicated anything, I would send a message to inquire if the meeting is still on and when I can expect your supervisor to join.


- Draft the communications you would send to your supervisor and when you would send each of these communications:

Communication 1:
Subject: Confirmation of meeting

Dear [Supervisor's name],

I wanted to confirm our meeting scheduled for today at 3 pm over Zoom. I'll be waiting for you on the call and I'll make sure to have all the necessary documents and information ready for discussion.

Please let me know if there's any changes to the schedule or if you need any more information from me in the meantime.

Thank you,
Ayrene Santos

I wanted to check in with you about our meeting scheduled for today at 3 pm over Zoom. It's 3:05 pm now and I haven't seen you yet on the call. Is there any issues that arose that prevented you from joining the meeting?

Please let me know if you are running late or if there's any changes to the schedule and when you expect to join.
