Subject: Introduction and Project Questions

Dear John,

I hope you're doing well. My name is Mark and I've recently been assigned to work on your project. I wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself and to express my excitement about working on this project with you.

As I'm new to this project, I wanted to clarify some things with you to make sure that I understand your expectations and requirements for the project. Can you please provide me with more information about what work I should be doing each day? Also, when would be a good time for us to schedule regular check-ins to discuss the project status and any other questions or concerns that may arise?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm experienced in both front-end and back-end development and I'm confident that I'll be able to deliver the project on time and to your satisfaction.

I will send this email on Monday morning, as it's the start of a new week, it's a good time to set up a schedule for the upcoming week and also it's a good time for you to be in the office and review my email.

Please let me know if you need any more information from me in the meantime.

Thank you,
Mark
