1. What went wrong with these situations?

I were given a project and told my supervisor that I would have it completed by next Wednesday, however, I didn't finish the project and my supervisor forgot about it and didn't follow up with me at all.

2. How could you have handled this situation better?
I could have set up regular check-ins with my supervisor throughout the week to update them on my progress and ensure that they were aware of my progress. I could have also sent a reminder email to my supervisor on Tuesday, the day before the deadline, to let them know that the project was not yet completed and to discuss any further steps that need to be taken.

3. If you were to go back on time, when would you go back to, and what email communication would you send and why?

I would go back to Friday the previous week, and I would send an email to my supervisor to discuss the project status, and to confirm the deadline, and also ask for any help or resources that I may need.

4. Who was ultimately responsible for this project being completed? Who should have followed up first? The supervisor or you?

Both me and my supervisor are ultimately responsible for the project being completed on time. However, it is common for the person who is assigned a project to follow up with their supervisor to ensure that they are on track and to address any issues that may arise.

- If you could go back to Friday the previous week (before the project was due), what would you do differently? Draft an email communication to your project manager.

Subject: Project status update

Dear [Supervisor's name],

I wanted to follow up with you regarding the project you assigned to me last week. I wanted to confirm that the deadline for the project is next Wednesday, and also to know if there's any help or resources that I may need to complete the project on time.

I've been working hard during my usual hours/week and I'm confident that with your guidance and some dedicated time, I'll be able to meet the deadline. I wanted to schedule a meeting with you or a call to discuss the project status and to make sure that we are on the same page.

Please let me know when would be a good time for us to meet or talk, and if you need any more information from me in the meantime.

Thank you,
Ayrene Santos

- If you could go back to Tuesday (the day before the deadline), and assuming you’ve done absolutely your best to finish the project but just weren’t able to, what email would you draft to the communication to your project manager?
Subject: Project deadline - next Wednesday

Dear [Supervisor's name],

I wanted to follow up with you regarding the project you assigned to me last week. I wanted to inform you that I haven't been able to complete the project yet, despite my best efforts. I understand that the deadline is tomorrow, Wednesday and I wanted to know what are the next steps, and if there is any way that I can get help or resources to complete the project.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I am willing to put in extra hours or work over the weekend to ensure that the project is completed as soon as possible.

Please let me know what you would like me to do, and if you need any more information from me in the meantime.

Thank you,
Ayrene Santos
